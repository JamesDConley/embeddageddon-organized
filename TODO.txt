For some reason, the autoencoder outputs are now like all full 1s or -1s 
There must be a bug in the refactor somehow.

Possible causes
- Dataset changes (memmap/preloaded dataset for autoencoder)
- Batch size increase from ~64ish to 8192 (though this seems weird)
- Reorg of autoencoder code? Unclear.
